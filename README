# Hardware
The aim of this repo is to have a PCB on which I was able to mount a standard
[Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
and have an extended duel PMod Connector. This would allow me to connect up
the Raspberry Pi Pico upto a range of PMod Boards that I already own, as well
as to connect it upto some of the FPGA boards that I already own though there
PMod connector.

For working with the pre existing PMod Boards I've made a PMod Host board,
this hosts the accessories such as an [Seven Segment display]() or
[PMOD buttons]()
